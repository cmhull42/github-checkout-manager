github-checkout-manager
========
A HTTP server that will listen for a webhooks push from github, and automatically grab the latest changes and deploy them to a directory.
Useful for websites, so that you can update the live site by pushing to a branch of your choosing

# Setup ###


Grab the source and stick it in a directory of your choosing on your webserver. Permissions will be easiest to manage and most secure if you create a new user for github-checkout-manager.

# Config file ###

Put as many repos as you would like in the json config file. Each repo needs the following information:

**type** - the type of repository this is. Options: `go`, `raw` (default)  
go will perform a go get -u and copy the binary, whereas raw will copy the repo files directly

**user** - The github username the repo belongs to i.e. (cmhull42)

**name** - The official name of the repository i.e. (github-checkout-manager)

**branch** - The branch you would like to track updates to - currently only supports master

**configdirectory** - this directory should contain a cloned copy of the repo (with the same name) and optionally a private key id_rsa to authenticate to github with.  
This parameter will not be used if **type** is `go`

**contentdirectory** - the directory to deploy the code to i.e. (/var/www/connoor.io)
